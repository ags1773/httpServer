BUGS:

1) Body length mismatch with Content-Length header
  - sending POST request with binary data (text file)
  - data sent over multiple chunks
  - doing body += chunk for each chunk
  - conttent length header is slightly greater than calculated length of body (contentLength, bodyLength 391811 391783)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN should server close the socket connection?

- server is supposed to return response after the client finishes sending all the data
- Therefore, the server has to evaluate that it has received entire data by looking at the data itself according to specification of HTTP protocol

HTTP-message = start-line
*( header-field CRLF )
CRLF
[ message-body ]

- server calculates the end of header-field with receiving double CRLF
  CLRF appears at end of header, and again in the next empty line

- check if it's a GET or POST request
- if GET, do further processing and close the socket
- if POST, check for content-length header
- check if recieved data chunk has length equal to content-length. If yes, do further processing and close socket
- if not, wait for some time for more data chunks
- close connection
