- make post request to server with binary data (text file)
- dump.txt will be created with post data
- server is able to deal with multiple chunks of data
- timeout has been tested for as low as 10 ms, still works! It has been set to 2 seconds for demo purpose

-----------------------

curl command to make POST request with binary data (file 'wireless-info.txt' in current dir):
curl --request POST --data-binary "@wireless-info.txt" localhost:3000

keepAlive:
- http Agent is responsible for managing connection persistence and reuse of HTTP clients
- it maintains a queue of pending requests for a given host and port, reusing the socket 
  connection until the queue is empty
- after this, the socket is either destroyed, or put in a pool where it's kept to be used again for requests
  to the same host and port
- whether it's destroyed or pooled depends on the 'keepAlive' option
