BUGS:
1) POST request:
  - doesn't execute handler the 1st time after starting server
  - works second time onward

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Solved Bugs:

1) Body length mismatch with Content-Length header
  - sending POST request with binary data (text file)
  - data sent over multiple chunks
  - doing body += chunk for each chunk
  - conttent length header is slightly greater than calculated length of body (contentLength, bodyLength 391811 391783)

Solution
- use buffers to concatinate data chunks, not strings
- "You need to set the content length using Buffer.byteLength not string.length."
- https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/1816

2) Content-length mismatch for .png files
  - solved after using buffers

3) res.render('test.html')
  res.render('/jjjj')
  throws error saying write after socket close. It should give a correct error
  
  - Not a bug, express does the same thing
